Meritocracy---that idea that if one works hard, one can get ahead---is a core tenet of the American Dream \citep[see, e.g.][21-23]{Hochschild1995}. How belief in meritocracy, and in turn the country’s dominant ideology, fares in the face of the stark economic inequality that has come to characterize life in the United States over the past four decades is therefore crucial to understanding not only support for redistributive policies to address this inequality but also the continuing legitimacy of the U.S. economic system as a whole. Not surprisingly, this question and related ones regarding the relationship between economic inequality and political attitudes and beliefs have attracted considerable scholarly attention of late. 
In contrast to a range of earlier studies that found that greater inequality tends to be associated with attitudes that reinforce the status quo, \citet{Newman2015} advances the argument that inequality in the United States activates class conﬂict, leading poorer individuals in local contexts of higher inequality to reject meritocracy and become more class conscious. We demonstrate here, however, that that article crucially misinterprets the interaction term in its model \citep[see, e.g.,][]{Brambor2006}. Correcting this error and bringing more and better data reveals that there is no support for the paper’s sanguine conclusion that mere exposure to high levels of inequality stimulates a rejection of meritocracy. Our analysis ﬁnds no evidence that high levels of local economic inequality work to activate an ``oppositional consciousness'' among lower-income individuals and so are ultimately self-correcting. To the contrary, but consistent with relative power theory, the results indicate that lower-income individuals are less likely to reject the meritocratic ideal where economic inequality is greater. 

A Review of the Theories at Stake
The crucial relationship between economic inequality and system-supporting beliefs like meritocracy is the subject of two diametrically opposed theories: the conﬂict theory and the relative power theory. As noted above, NJL advocates the conﬂict theory. Based on the rational-actor perspective, this theory maintains that, for lower-income individuals, being confronted with high levels of inequality locally ``increases the salience of their disadvantaged position within a conspicuous local economic hierarchy (NJL, 327). Greater class consciousness (and, in turn, increased demand for redistribution) then follows. Higher-income individuals in high inequality contexts, on the other hand, are expected be more likely to believe in the importance of individual eﬀort to the distribution of economic rewards. The conﬂict theory has received sustained attention, but empirical support has been at best mixed \citep[on the U.S. case, see][]{Oliver2001, Brady2004, Solt2010}. 
The relative power theory, on the other hand, starts with the proposition that money is a political resource: that is, that it can be used to inﬂuence others. Therefore, the theory contends, where the rich are richer relative to the poor, they will also be more powerful relative to the poor \citep{Goodin1980}. This theory suggests that the greater power imbalance from economic inequality provides high-income people with more resources to spread their views in the public sphere while depriving poorer people to a greater degree of the resources to resist these eﬀorts. This gives poorer people ``a greater susceptibility to the internalization of the values, beliefs, or rules of the game of the powerful'' \citep[17]{Gaventa1980}. Patterns of religiosity \citep[see][]{Solt2011a, Solt2014b} and respect for authority \citep[see][]{Solt2012} have been found to provide support for this theory.
