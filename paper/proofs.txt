Jungmin: I think we can ignore this one.
Note(5-Erico): it is just a site for date replication; I think we can change our description of the data (on p.6) and just refer it to Newman 2015a (as the editors suggest in no.11? Meanwhile, I also find that Newman made two corrections to their paper on Volume 60(3).

Note(10-Erico): I believe it's an open access journal (and do not have a print copy?) the citation guide of "page 1-31" is probably the length of the paper, not the actual page numbers in the "printed journal". Should use DOI instead: 10.18637/jss.v045.i02; 

**Hu**: Agree to Jungmin.

- [ ] 11 In the Figure 1 footnotes, should the citation ‘...estimated from the data and model provided in Newman et al. (2015b)’ be changed to ‘2015a’, as per citation in the caption?

Jungmin: 

Note(11-Erico): This is what I mean in note 5. I agree the change proposed by the editors here.
