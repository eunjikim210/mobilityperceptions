Do higher levels of local income inequality lead to disillusionment with the dominant U.S. ideology of meritocracy?  A recent study concluding it does was not reproducible, leaving these questions open.  The present work brings more and better data and an improved specification--including local rates of intergeneration mobility--to examine how, if at all, local contexts of income inequality shape Americans' beliefs that people can get ahead if they are willing to work hard.
