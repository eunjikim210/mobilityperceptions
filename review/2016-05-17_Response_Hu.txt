* the issue of tone and framing, as highlighted by both reviewers. There is no need for snark and we need to be precise about what is and is not a replication. What is ultimately our core interest here is understanding the very interesting substantive issues.

S: more description of the replication file

 
* the interpretation of the interaction term. Can you explain more precisely why the figures presented in the AJPS article are inaccurate or misleading? I also agree with R1 that we shouldn't overinterpret the .05 threshold. There still is a remarkable difference in the interaction term between the first study and the new study you conduct. We need to better understand what, precisely, is responsible for this radical change. Is it the county/commuter zone switch? The new dependent variable? The larger dataset? If it is possible to introduce these changes one-at-a-time? We may get a better understanding what modeling/data choices lead to such different inferences.

As noted above, what the author(s) state as a "crucial misinterpretation" of the interaction term, is actually more accurately described as the difference between p<.05 vs. p<.06 or .07.  The conditional marginal effect of Gini at the lowest level of personal income is positive and just barely crosses the zero line. 

（Reviewer 1：I realize that the authors are alleging that NJL misinterpreted the coefficients
of their models, but the NJL results are also presented in Figures which appear to show
that the interactions work in the manner claimed. What is going on here? Did the
authors of this article look at the NJL code and see how they arrived at these figures?）

 
S: I may understand the second reviewer incorrectly, or he/she may not know how to interpret interaction, either. More methodological discussion about interaction and perhaps use NJL's data.
 
 
One of the main arguments of NJL is that low and high income citizens' views about meritocracy polarize as inequality increases, and this polarization should be replicable in using the NJL data.  Thus, there are two important pieces: (1) whether each income group becomes significantly more rejecting/accepting of meritocracy due to increases in inequality, and (2) whether significant differences BETWEEN income groups emerge as inequality increases.  The author(s) of this should be clear to differentiate the two, and to engage the latter (as well as the former) in addressing an attempt to replicate NJL.

S: is that interaction, too?  
 

* I think the tone of the article can be somewhat less snarky. For instance, to criticize the NJL argument the authors say that it is grounded in the “implausible premise that social structures are self-negating.” But clearly, some social structures must be self-negating or you would never see change take place. One other example is the use of the word ”strangely” on line 31 of p. 7. While it is possible that NJL intentionally deceived, much more likely is that they simply made a coding mistake. These are just two examples, but be on the lookout for this type of language throughout during the revisions.

S: delete the "snarky" words.


* inequality is measured in 1996-2000 and the survey was conducted in 2007. Is it possible that some local areas (CZs or counties) had major reductions/increases in inequality? Admittedly, there is almost certainly a very high correlation between inequality in 2000 and inequality in 2007 for the vast majority of counties, but I would like to see some defense of this in the article, whether this includes data or a reference to other studies showing that inequality remains fairly constant across different geographical units over time. I realize the Chetty data are from a particular time period but are there other data sources that may be used?

S: Fred, do we have theoretical argument responding to that?

* I think relative power theory would predict that the wealthy would become more supportive of the belief in meritocracy as it increases, but this is not the case. Why is there this asymmetry? 

S: one footnote task.

* I understood the implications of Figure 5 by carefully reading the description in the text, but clearly axis values/lables are missing and are needed. There is no legend, etc. The conclusion is a bit terse. I would like to see another couple of sentences on the implications of the findings.

S: some discussion as I did for the class-consciousness paper
 
* This is because using the data of NJL, the authors do not fail to replicate, they instead make a mountain out of a molehill ala the difference between p<.05 and p<.06 (discussed more below), and because the measurement issue discussed by the author(s) of this manuscript is not demonstrated in either this manuscript or NJL to counter the core findings of NJL or the conclusions drawn in NJL.

S: lay out the difficulties and weirdos in NJL's replication file

* Thus, what the author(s) of this paper is essentially sitting on is a much LARGER dataset than NJL, an analysis that has some key measurement differences from NJL (e.g., measurement of context), and offers some interesting and important findings that run counter to NJL. Many important literatures in the study of public opinion offer countervailing findings, such as the study of racial context.  Here, as in that literature, some of the variation in findings is linked to variation in features of the data, measurement, models, etc. 

S: discuss about the consistency of substantive meaning, lighten the discussion about p-value

* With respect to measurement of the dependent variable, the author(s) of this manuscript criticize NJLs collapsing of different versions of the "hard work" and "success" items from the Pew Surveys, but do not actually provide any compelling demonstration of how this practice induces results that are not there, or is actually problematic. Further, in reviewing NJL, the authors note in their measurement section, in footnote 3, that the results they present are not driven by variation in DV measurement, as the results hold when restricting the analysis to the two surveys where the DV is measured the same way.  


S: show a strict replication with different DVs. Regarding the footnote:Probably show how the distribution of DV was driven by 2005-2006.


* I would caution the author(s) about over-selling their use of commuter zones (CZs) instead of counties as an improvement in the data and analysis.  CZs are also very large geographic units, and may even be larger than counties in many cases.  I have yet to see any definitive evidence that demonstrates that CZs better capture citizens' daily environment - both in terms of where they spend most of their time and interact with/observe the most people - than zip code, county, etc.  
 
I would suggest that the authors instead just position CZs as an alternative measure of context, and present results from their analyses using CZs AND counties.   Indeed, not using counties strikes me as odd given the author(s) motive to replicate NJL.  I apologize if the author(s) did run analyses using county but I overlooked reference to this in the text or in a footnote.

(Reviewer 1: the authors use CZs rather than counties, but I would like to see whether the results differ if one uses counties. I actually agree that CZs are better for the purpose, but it would be interesting to see if the counties produce different results.)


S: probably following their suggestion?
 
* Perhaps what would be ideal would be to present results with AND without these variables included as control, as justifications can be made for their exclusion as post-treatment or their inclusion as pre-treatment (i.e., residential self-selection).  

S: follow the suggestion
