Addresses much more completely in memoCommentsFred:It looks like we may need to take another day or two to tie up our loose ends before we proceed with the hand-off to the ÒverificationÓ step.Discussion of interaction in memo may be a bit long, might need some trimmingWhat it means to make reviewers happy:	It does not mean to Òroll-overÓ on everything, donÕt concede every point	For example:  DonÕt agree that we have used a ÒsnarkyÓ tone	Think like a lawyer Ð never concede a point that makes your client look bad	Make all reasonable concessions Ð make it clear that insisting on further revisions would be unreasonable. By giving serious consideration to each point that a reviewer makes we make further insistence regarding those points unreasonable.		We want to address reviewersÕ comments, while preserving our version of the paper Ð only if a reviewer convinces you that the vision of the paper should be altered should you do so. Maintain the vision of the paper while making ÒreasonableÓ changes as requested.	We then want to portray what we have done in the best possible light	Making reviewers happy consists of a continuum, ranging from the things we roll over on, to the things we change a little bit and then portray in the best light possible, to the things that we donÕt change at all (these must be justified Ð make it clear that you have taken each point they made seriously).4/5 levels of reviewer comments and appropriate responses      ->Comments that help you make the piece better==> comments that maybe make the piece better but you donÕt wholly agree with==> comments that compromise the vision of the paper but you address/take seriously==> comments (limited to 1 per reviewer) that you acknowledge having considered, but choose not to incorporate==> May sometimes be things that you can choose to completely ignore Ð but EXERCISE CAUTION in doing this.Moving ForwardWe are going to continue to frame this as a reproduction and replication that aims to correct the record Ð an approach that to anyone other than NJL will seem reasonable	This means that we need to proceed as though reviewer 2 is NOT one of the authors	We also need to proceed as though the editor will send the revised ms back to reviewer 2Time Table:We need to have a finalized draft done by June 21st *	This means out initial and secondary tasks must be done by then	Fred will then look overNeed to have primary task wrapped up by afternoon on Thursday June 9th *Need to have secondary responsibilities complete by June 21st Meet at 9 am June 21st
